I would argue that proper planning and preparation of food is MOST important, yet probably the LEAST focused on aspect of a person's training.  Many who desire to lose weight will kill it in the gym for the first few weeks, stunning their friends and family with their workout dedication and prowess, complete with gym selfies and hashtags like #nopainnogain or #idontsweatiglow. But when it comes to the kitchen they are unknowingly sabotaging all their hard work at the gym.

Think about it. Even the highest intensity workouts for the average gym-goer (read: not riding the eliptical while scanning Facebook) will be lucky to burn 400-500 calories in an hour, depending on that person's fitness level and weight. That same person can then visit Red Lobster Friday night and consume 320 calories in two cheddar bay biscuits and 1400 calories by indulging in the Chocolate Wave Cake. That's 1720 calories without the main course taken into account! Often times these weekend treats sabotage an entire week at the gym and - if the person is lucky - he or she *might* break even on the scale. 

Without the proper nutrition to fuel the body, a person can not perform optimally and results will be severely stunted, if not completely non-existent. Let's take a look at how you can take a few hours once a week and set yourself up for success when it comes to nutrition.

## Meal Planning

Different people have different needs based on the work their bodies need to do. So the goal of this article is not to give a one size fits all example; but instead, provide you with some good sources of protein, healthy fats and low-glycemic carbohydrates. It should be noted that those with food allergies/sensitivities or medical conditions should consult their doctor when making big changes to their diet and exercise program. 

## Food Prep & Storage

Example Grocery List
1. Two packages pre-cut butternut squash
2. One small bag of craisins 
2. Two packages boneless-skinless chicken thighs
3. Large bag of apples
4. Six large sweet potatoes 
5. Two containers low-fat *plain* greek yogurt

Let's start with the boneless, skinless chicken thighs. Take the thighs out of the package and put on a foiled pan sprayed with Pam. Very lightly brush with olive oil and your favorite salt-free seasoning. Bake approximately 30 minutes at 350 degrees.

In the meantime, while your chicken is cooking, take out the pre-cut butternut squash and cut into equal sized cubes, toss with cinnamon and a few tablespoons olive oil. Set aside.

Next, take your potatoes and spray individual pieces of foil with pam. Wash potatoes and place on the foil and wrap them up (skin stays on). Set aside. At this time you can also slice about 8 large apples into pieces and place in a baking dish with a touch of water on the bottom and plenty of cinnamon. Set aside. 

When the chicken is done, take it out and place the thighs on a plate and let them cool down a bit. Next turn the oven temperature to 450 degrees and pan the butternut squash and place in the oven for 15-20 minutes. At that point, take it out and flip the squash so it cooks evenly throughout. Add some craisins on top and bake for an additional 15 minutes.

While the squash finishes up, you can begin to weigh out your chicken and beginning the bagging process. I separate my chicken into 4oz portions. The bagging system has worked very well for my husband and I because it allows us to "grab and go" as needed and it has taken the guesswork out of opening up our fridge and wondering what we should eat, not to mention it gives us the correct portion every time!

When the butternut squash is finished, take it out and let cool and then bag into 3/4 cup portions.

You can bring the oven temperature back down to 350 degrees and place your foil-wrapped sweet potatoes on the pan and bake until soft (at least an hour and a half depending on how large they are). You can also put the apples in at that time and bake for approximately 30 minutes or until soft. I add about 6 baked apple slices in some of their natural juice to 1 cup plain greek yogurt that I will have after my workout, which provides a nice carbohydrate and natural sugar boost to replenish my system.

When the sweet potatoes are done, cut them in half and bag them up! Each portion should be about 3/4 cup.

## Pantry Cleanse 

The last thing I will say when it comes to conquering your kitchen is this: get rid of the things that tempt you. If you don't have it, you won't eat it. For those of us with kids, it can be a tough balance to keep some fun snacks around that they enjoy without compromising your own goals. I have put some of the kids snacks out in the garage which has made it harder for me to get to for myself but still accessible while I am packing lunches or getting a snack for them. Get rid of as many things as possible that doesn't come from animals, the sea, trees or the ground. 

There are many studies around whether or not a "cheat meal" is helpful or not when it comes to dieting and making progress. I'll be blunt and honest and tell you that cheat meals will only hinder your results. Chris Shugart, who is a chief contributor for T Nation's blog - says this:

> The problem with cheat meals is that, once a week or so, you give this bad gut bacteria everything it wants and you help build the colony, which then pillages the village of good bacteria. And that means your cravings for junk never subside. In fact, they get worse.

> How do you kill or at least reduce the hungry gut bugs? Well, you starve them. You abstain from cheat foods.

> Oh, they'll fight you. There's a very real addiction thing going on here. And you'll have to suffer for a bit until balance is restored. But then the cravings go away. If you find yourself wanting the healthy foods and not being tempted by the junk foods, you've turned a corner. Staying lean will now be much easier.

So get in that kitchen and set yourself up for success. Fill the fridge with pre-measured, healthy options and rid the fridge, freezer and pantry of the things that have no place in your new lifestyle. The kitchen is by far the hardest place to conquer. I hope that these tips will help it become just a little bit easier.
