Self-improvement, or at least the desire for it, is a shared American hobby. It's why so many of us - some estimates say more than 40% of Americans - make New Year's resolutions. But for all the good intentions, only a tiny fraction of us keep our resolutions. University of Scranton research suggests that just 9% of people achieve [their New Year's resolution](http://www.statisticbrain.com/new-years-resolution-statistics/).

So what is the secret that those 9% of Americans have that the rest of us are missing? I’d like to suggest four reason we fail - specifically relating to fitness and weight loss goals - and what we can do differently. 

**Vague, Unattainable or Unrealistic Goals** 
 “Lose weight” is not an effective goal. Neither is “get in shape.” These larger goals need to be broken down into specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time bound goals - SMART goals. By using this method you can take the vague idea of “Lose Weight/Get in Shape” and transform it into reality.

*Specific*: The goals must specifically state what is to be accomplished. They must be easily understood and should not be ambiguous or subject to interpretation.

*Measurable*: The goals must be measurable so that there is no doubt about whether you achieved them. Measurable goals also allow you to evaluate your progress and builds confidence in the fact that you can do it. 

*Attainable*: The goals must be attainable - not too difficult or too easy. Easy goals do not motivate, and overly difficult ones may frustrate you and lead to a perception of failure, which is the biggest reason people give up on their goals. 

*Relevant*: The goals must be relevant or pertinent to your particular interests, needs and abilities. If your goal is the run a 5K, you need to focus most of your workouts on improving your cardiovascular endurance.

*Time-Bound*: The goals must be time-bound by specific deadlines for completion. Timelines should be both short-term and long-term. This is huge. When you need to lose a significant amount of weight, you have to focus on setting short-term goals (think weekly and monthly goals) which will keep you on the right path toward accomplishing the big goal.

For examples on how to implement smart goals, check out my post on Reaching Your Goals the SMART Way. 

**Low Self Efficacy**
When we talk about self efficacy, we are talking about a person’s self-confidence in their ability to make a change. If a person has tried over and over to lose weight or has tried every conceivable fad diet with no success, they will inevitably have low self efficacy. If this sounds like you, here is what you can do. Implement short-term SMART goals - goals that can be accomplished each week for the first few months. As you begin to see success your self efficacy will gradually improve and you will be more motivated to stick with your fitness plan. 

**Extrinsic Motivation**
Motivation is the psychological drive to engage in a behavior. Many times our motivation for eating healthy and exercising is purely extrinsic and our SMART goals follow suit to reflect these values. We desire to engage in physical activity simply because it will give us tangible results - losing weight, looking better, lowering blood pressure, living longer. If this is the only reason you are engaging in exercise you will suffer through your workouts at best and at worse continue to fail over and over again. 

So what can you do differently? Extrinsic motivation is good - but you need to develop some intrinsic motivation as well. We could call these “non-scale” related reasons you are putting in the work at the gym and in the kitchen. This is a great opportunity to start a health journal. Document your accomplishments - no matter how big or how small. Think about how you want to feel about yourself. Find ways to exercise that are enjoyable. Explore ways to be active that excite you. Think back on activities you used to enjoy that you may no longer be able to do because of your health. Use this as motivation to keep putting in the work and you will find reason and motivation to keep it up long after your extrinsic goals are accomplished.

**Perceived Lack of Time **
The number one reason people drop out of exercise programs is perceived lack of time. Many of us are extremely busy and way overcommitted. And unfortunately our health doesn’t take priority. Take a look at your schedule and commitments and make a list of everything you are committed to. Divide them into the non negotiables (things that you have to do) and the negotiables (things that you chose to do because you want to, like to or think you need to). Start crossing some of these off. Make your health a top priority - if you don’t, nobody will for you. In addition, think creatively about ways you can be active during your non negotiable commitments. Play with your kids instead of being on your phone - run, jump, giggle, swing. Take the stairs instead of the elevator. Bring your sneaker to work and use your lunch hour to go for a walk. You will come to find out that your perceived lack of time is just that - perceived. There are always things we can cut out to make time for fitness and health. 

**Poor Planning **
This is a big one. You get home after a busy day of work, open the fridge and find nothing prepared. You have no energy or desire to cook so what do you do? Think about what you are ‘in the mood for’ - which is likely not a fresh salad from Saladworks - and order take out. So how can you avoid being taken away by every whim of your cravings? Take a day each week and do food prep for the week. Cook off lean proteins, vegetables and low-glycemic starches (sweet potatoes, butternut squash, spaghetti squash) and measure out the portions and pre-bag everything. That way when you open the fridge you will always have something available to you that is a good choice. 

But what about those special events that you want to ‘treat yourself?” Super Bowl is coming up and there are surely going to be tons of not-so-good-for-you food available for the eating. Instead of treating yourself in the ways you used to (sugar, salt and carbs, oh my!), think of a healthier option that you don’t indulge in very often. For my husband and I, it’s snow crab legs and shrimp. Treat yourself in that way and you will continue to make progress toward your goals. 

Let’s aim to be part of that 9% and hopefully we will see a greater percentage of people achieving the weight loss and fitness goals they set out to accomplish. You can do it!
